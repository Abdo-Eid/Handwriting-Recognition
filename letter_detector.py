    Explanation:
        Horizontal Overlap:
        -------------------
        Two boxes are considered to overlap horizontally if their projections on the 
        x-axis intersect. Mathematically, horizontal overlap exists if:
        
            min(x2_box1, x2_box2) > max(x1_box1, x1_box2)
            min of the right boundaries of the boxes is greater than the max of the left boundaries.

        Where:
            - x1_box1 and x2_box1 are the left and right boundaries of the first box.
            - x1_box2 and x2_box2 are the left and right boundaries of the second box.

        The overlap width is calculated as:
        
            overlap_width = min(x2_box1, x2_box2) - max(x1_box1, x1_box2)

        If overlap_width > 0, the boxes overlap horizontally.

        Visual Representation of Horizontal Overlap:
        --------------------------------------------
        Case 1: Overlapping boxes
            Box 1: |---10---[Box1]---30---|
            Box 2:          |---20---[Box2]---40---|

            Overlapping region is between 20 and 30 (width = 10).

        Case 2: Non-overlapping boxes
            Box 1: |---10---[Box1]---30---|
            Box 2:                             |---40---[Box2]---60---|

            No overlap as thereâ€™s no intersection on the x-axis.

        Merging Conditions:
        -------------------
        Two boxes are merged if:
            1. They overlap horizontally (as defined above).
            2. The vertical distance between the bottom of one box and the top of the 
               other is less than or equal to max_distance.

        The merged box is the smallest bounding rectangle that encompasses both boxes.
